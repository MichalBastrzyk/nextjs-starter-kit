# Authentication Implementation Todos

This document outlines the step-by-step process for implementing the authentication system using Better Auth library.

## Phase 1: Core Authentication Setup

- [x] Install Better Auth

  ```bash
  npm install better-auth
  # Additional packages as needed
  npm install better-auth/react better-auth/next-js
  ```

- [x] Set up database schema for authentication

  ```bash
  npx @better-auth/cli migrate
  ```

- [x] Create basic auth configuration file

  ```typescript
  // lib/auth.ts
  import { betterAuth } from "better-auth"

  export const auth = betterAuth({
    adapter: "your-database-adapter", // Choose appropriate adapter
    emailAndPassword: {
      enabled: true,
    },
  })
  ```

- [x] Set up API route handler

  ```typescript
  // app/api/auth/[...all]/route.ts
  import { toNextJsHandler } from "better-auth/next-js"

  import { auth } from "@/lib/auth"

  export const { POST, GET } = toNextJsHandler(auth)
  ```

- [x] Create client-side auth hooks

  ```typescript
  // lib/auth-client.ts
  import { createAuthClient } from "better-auth/react"

  export const authClient = createAuthClient({
    baseURL: process.env.BASE_URL!,
  })

  export const { signIn, signOut, useSession } = authClient
  ```

- [x] Implement sign-up functionality

  - [x] Create sign-up form
  - [x] Connect to Better Auth client
  - [ ] Add validation for user inputs
    - [ ] Create a custom password component that will allow for previewing of the password
    - [ ] Move the form to react-hook-form which will validate the password complexity using zod schema
    - [ ] Format the error message to be more user friendly

- [x] Implement login functionality

  - [x] Create login form
  - [x] Connect to Better Auth client
  - [ ] Handle authentication errors
    - [ ] Add a banner notification to the bottom of the form

- [x] Implement logout functionality

- [ ] Create password reset flow

  - [ ] Request password reset form
    - [ ] Add a banner notification to the bottom of the form
      - [ ] Which says that the email has been sent with a link to reset the password
      - [ ] Which says what error occurred if there was one
  - [ ] Password reset confirmation page
    - [ ] Add a banner notification to the bottom of the form
      - [ ] Which says that the password has been reset
      - [ ] Which says what error occurred if there was one

  - [ ] Email verification confirmation page
    - [ ] Add a banner notification to the bottom of the form
      - [ ] Which says that the email has been verified
      - [ ] Which says what error occurred if there was one
