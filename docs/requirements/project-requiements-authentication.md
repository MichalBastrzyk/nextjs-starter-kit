# Auth Requirements

## Overview

This document outlines the requirements for implementing authentication functionality in the application. The system will allow users to sign up, log in, and manage their accounts using Next.js and drizzle-orm for database operations.

Users can be of different roles:

- Admin
- User

Admins can:

- Create, read, update and delete any users

Users can:

- Modify their own account information

## Functional Requirements

### User Authentication

- [x] Users must be able to sign up using email and password
- [x] Users must be able to log in using email and password
- [x] Users must be able to log out
- [x] Users must be able to reset their password
- [x] Users must be able to verify their email
- [x] Implement session management with secure cookies (e.g., HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite)
- [ ] (Optional) Provide option for social logins (e.g., Google, GitHub)
- [ ] (Optional) Implement magic link login as an alternative method
- [ ] Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA/2FA) as an optional security feature for users
- [ ] Define and enforce session timeout/expiry policies (e.g., auto-logout after period of inactivity)
- [ ] Implement account lockout after multiple failed login attempts
- [ ] Send security notifications for critical account events (login from new device, password change)

### User Management

Users:

- [x] Users must be able to modify their account information
  - [x] Name
  - [x] Email (requires re-verification)
  - [x] Password
  - [x] Profile Picture (upload or URL)
- [ ] Users must be able to export their account data (GDPR compliance)
- [x] Users must be able to delete their account with clear data retention policy

Admins:

- [x] Admins must be able to view all users (with pagination/search)
- [x] Admins must be able to view any specific user's account information
- [x] Admins must be able to create new users manually
- [x] Admins must be able to modify any user's account information (including roles)
- [x] Admins must be able to assign/change user roles
- [ ] Admins must be able to delete any user's account (soft delete recommended)
- [ ] Admins must be able to temporarily suspend/unsuspend user accounts
- [ ] Admins must be able to trigger password reset for any user
- [ ] Admins must be able to manually verify any user's email

## Security Requirements

- [x] All passwords must be securely hashed and salted before storage (e.g., using bcrypt or Argon2).
- [ ] Implement rate limiting on login, sign-up, and password reset endpoints to mitigate brute-force attacks.
- [x] Validate and sanitize all user inputs related to authentication (email format, password complexity rules).
- [x] Ensure secure handling and storage/invalidation of sessions and tokens.
- [ ] Protect against common web vulnerabilities (CSRF, XSS) in authentication forms and processes.
- [ ] Implement basic Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) checks on API routes and UI elements based on user role.
- [x] Define and enforce comprehensive password policies:
  - [x] Minimum length (8+ characters recommended)
  - [x] Complexity requirements (combination of letters, numbers, special characters)
  - [x] Prevention of common/compromised passwords
  - [ ] Password rotation policy (if required)
- [ ] Implement secure API authentication strategy (JWT, OAuth) with proper token management
- [ ] Maintain comprehensive audit logs for authentication events (login attempts, password changes, role modifications)
- [ ] Define data retention policies for inactive accounts and deleted user data

## Non-Functional Requirements

- [ ] Authentication flows should be responsive and provide a good user experience on various devices.
- [ ] Sensitive operations (login, password change, email verification) should give clear feedback (success/error states).
- [ ] Authentication-related errors should be logged appropriately for monitoring and debugging.

## Accessibility and Internationalization

- [ ] Authentication interfaces must be fully accessible (WCAG 2.1 AA compliant)
- [ ] Authentication error messages must be clear and descriptive for screen readers
- [ ] Support for multiple languages in authentication interfaces and email templates
- [ ] Right-to-left (RTL) language support for authentication interfaces

## Privacy and Compliance

- [ ] Clear privacy notices during registration explaining data usage
- [ ] Cookie consent management for authentication cookies
- [ ] Data minimization - only collect necessary authentication information
- [ ] Regional compliance with privacy regulations (GDPR, CCPA, etc.)
- [ ] Consent management for marketing communications and data processing

## Device and Session Management

- [x] Users must be able to view all active sessions across devices
- [x] Users must be able to terminate any active session remotely
- [ ] Users should receive notifications about new device logins
- [ ] Users should be able to assign recognizable names to trusted devices

## Recovery and Backup Options

- [ ] Alternative account recovery methods beyond email (e.g., recovery codes)
- [ ] Backup authentication methods if primary method is unavailable
- [ ] Clear process for handling lost access to authentication factors

## Implementation Priorities

1. Core authentication (signup, login, logout, password reset)
2. Basic security measures (password hashing, input validation)
3. User profile management
4. Admin features
5. Enhanced security features (MFA, session management)
6. Advanced features (social login, device management)

## Integration Requirements

- [ ] Authentication system must integrate with external services (if applicable)
- [ ] Single Sign-On (SSO) capabilities for enterprise users (if applicable)
- [ ] API for third-party integrations with the authentication system
